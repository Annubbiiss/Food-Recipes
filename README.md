# Food-Recipes
it's an amazing app that gives you full information about the many meals that you may dont know about and gives you an instructions of how to make that meal provided by a video.

Libraries and technologies used
Navigation component : To simplify the implementation of navigation in the app by providing a single, unified approach to handling navigation. Instead of using multiple techniques for different types of navigation
Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin object.
Room : Save the favorite meals in a local database.
MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
Coroutines : save the state of app
view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that and make it very easy and quick.
Glide : Catch images and load them in imageViews.
